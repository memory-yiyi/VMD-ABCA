# VMD-ABCA
ABCA is used to optimize the modal number and penalty coefficient of VMD. <br>
Before running, you need to have Matlab or its Runtime.
## Usage Method
1. You must have matlab or runtime. [Here is a link to download the MATLAB Runtime.](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html?s_tid=srchtitle_runtime_1) Please download the R2021a version of the runtime according to your operating system to support the running of the code.
2. Check whether there is deviation in each configuration. VS2022 is used here. If there is no error, you can compile and get the answer.
## Make changes
1. You can make changes to suit your needs. Before that, please check the notes. Here are some authors' opinions.
2. Code can be optimized. Welcome to discuss.
## Version Declaration
### Current Version
V0.2
### Author's idea
The number of iterations should be the same as the number of exhaustions, and the number of iterations should be controlled by variables. <br>
Usually this is very effective. It can control the number of iterations and consider the range of feasible solutions.
